Key features:
The main visualisation of GDP on X-axis and GCI on Y-axis shall be the first thing being seen. You may select to view any particular year at any time using the year slider. To control the animation playback over years click the "Play" button which also doubles as pause button. The animation will loop through years automatically.
The country region is presented with color blind friendly color set provided by ColorBrewer. Notice the black dot on X-axis, this is countries which have missing data in GCI.
Hover on bubbles to see population and country name.
Want to see a certain country's trace over year? Click the bubble, or input in the input box left of the "Show Trace" button above the plot.
By default, 12 pillars GCI shall be hidden. If a country is selected in "Show Trace" box, click "Show Pillars of GCI" shall open the pillars visualisation and autocomplete left view box with the same country name. Click "View" next to it to see pillars.
To show pillars for a second country, input country name in the box at the right bottom and hit "View". Again, if "Play" is hit, the pillars would loop through years automatically.

Design rationale:
While solving the problems, the easy to use and friendly to everyone is always on our mind.
That's why color blind friendly colors are used.
The scroll bar and play button is in the middle of two visualisations so that it's easy to change years, pause, play for both plots.
If you see an outstanding country bubble, you can click the bubble to fill in trace box. If you already have a country in your mind, drop box with autocomplete assist would be more handy to search than trying to find a bubble.
We assume if user is looking at a country's trace, he/she might be interested in seeing the pillars too. Therefore, the left pillar box is auto-filled with the same country and one click operation is saved. Also, after click "Show Pillars of GCI" the page will refocus on the pillar part and everything you want to play around with pillars is accessible without scrolling (self-contained in one screen). Either of the visualisations may be hidden at any time to enable focus only on the visualisation of interest.
